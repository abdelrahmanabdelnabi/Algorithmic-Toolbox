# Algorithmic Toolbox
This repo contains my solutions to the programming assignments of _Algorithmic Toolbox_, an online course offered by _University of California, San Diego_ as part of the _Data Structures and Algorithms_ Specialization on _[Coursera]()_.

This is first course in the 6 course specialization

The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming.
